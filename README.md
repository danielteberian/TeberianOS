# TeberianOS

This repository is the official source for my operating system. Rather than being built with the Linux kernel, all future development of TeberianOS will be on my own operating system, using my own kernel, boot-loader, etc.

I don't know how much I can do with this operating system, but I plan on improving it until I run out of things to do.
